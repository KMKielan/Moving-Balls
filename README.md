# Moving-Balls

## What This Repo Entails
Programs mainly written to emulate physics using balls. Most programs uploaded will involve graphical output of the physics I am trying to display using tkinter or any other appropriate graphical modules.

## Why This Repo Exists
This repo has been created as an area for safekeeping any programs written by myself. It will be used for the self-observation of my programming ability, hopefully showing improvement over the period of this repo's existence. It is also a place to show off the programs I have written and hopefully aid anyone searching for solutions closely related in subject to the programs I have written.
